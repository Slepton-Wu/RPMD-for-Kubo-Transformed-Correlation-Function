# RPMD-for-Kubo-Transformed-Correlation-Function

Here I calculated the (Kubo transformed) correlation function for harmonic, slightly anharmonic and completely anharmonic potentials using three methods:
- Exact quantum (by diagonalising the Hamiltonian matrix and evolving the eigenstates)
- Classical mechanics (propagating classical states with verlet algorithm)
- Ring polymer molecular dynamics (Metropolis sampling + verlet propagator)

It aims to replicate the result from this paper:
